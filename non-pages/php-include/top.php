We want we want an indicator to the user that knows where they are. This is done by printing the class="activePage" on active links in the nav menu, then styling the class "activePage" with css to have a highlight background color. So if it's the homepage, the "Home" link will be highlighted. If it's a dropdown, all levels of nav required to get to that page ar highlighted.
